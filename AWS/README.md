# AWS Q & A
- whatâ€™s EC2 Instance types?
  - There are numerous EC2 Instance types available, each designed to cater to specific workload requirements.
  Here are some commonly used EC2 Instance types: 
    1. `General Purpose Instances` (e.g., t2.micro, t3.medium) : These instances provide a balance of compute, memory, and network resources. They are suitable for a wide range of applications, including small to medium-sized databases, web servers, and development environments.
    2. `Compute-Optimized Instances`  (e.g., c5.large, c5.4xlarge): These instances are designed for high-performance computing tasks that require significant compute power. They are ideal for applications such as scientific modeling, batch processing, and machine learning inference.
